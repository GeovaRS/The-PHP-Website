I see many people asking in many community spaces
when PHP 7.5 will be released.

## PHP 7.5 Release Date

According to [Nikita's post this February 2020](https://twitter.com/nikita_ppv/status/1226791766088704000)
**PHP 7.4 is the last minor version in this major**,
meaning it will jump from PHP 7.4 to PHP 8.0.

**There won't be a PHP 7.5 release**.

I think it is time to [tweet this to all your PHP dev friends.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=PHP+7.5+will+be+skipped!!+-+See+https://thephp.website/en/issue/php-75-will-be-skipped/)
