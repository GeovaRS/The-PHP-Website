Some sources brought a bit of confusion about
PHP 8's release date. It is scheduled for December 2020,
not September 2021.

## PHP 8.0 Release Date

According to [Nikita's post in February 2020](https://twitter.com/nikita_ppv/status/1226791766088704000)
**PHP 8.0 will be released in December 2020**.

There are some sources indicating the date of September 2021.
They are wrong! PHP 8 is scheduled for December 2020.

## PHP 8's features

I wrote a list with PHP 8's confirmed features and
other plausible RFCs that might get included.
[You find such list in this post about PHP 8's features](/en/issue/php-8-features/).
