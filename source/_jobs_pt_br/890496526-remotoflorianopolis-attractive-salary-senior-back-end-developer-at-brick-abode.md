This is why we are so dedicated to functional programming, automated testing, and paying our people very well.

Our founder, Todd Lewis, had a multi-decade career in investment banking and information security in New York and Singapore. He came to Brazil because he was convinced that we have some of the best talent in the world, and our rapid growth since then suggests that he was right!

Our growth allows us to find and bring in the very best programmers in Brazil. People who want to build great solutions and use the very best systems to do so.
