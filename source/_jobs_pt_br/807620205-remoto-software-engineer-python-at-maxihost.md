# [Remoto] Software Engineer, Python @Maxihost

We believe there is a better way to work with technology. By building cutting-edge internet infrastructure products, our goal is to help make the internet faster and safer. That is why we take a different approach to infrastructure.

Our automated platform combines the flexibility of bare metal with the automation capabilities of the cloud, allowing our customers to deploy a dedicated server in minutes across different locations around the world.

Despite having several technical features and differentiators, we know that what makes our products and services great is our team and the people behind every single one of our achievements. Based on that, talent is something we are always looking for.

We work in an agile and highly collaborative environment, with all members of the Software Engineering team working remotely. We don’t use strict methodologies or copy industry standards. We’ve created our own workflow, which allows us to work calmly and productively. This workflow is public and can be found here.

As a Python Engineer, you'll be mostly working on internal tools, building integrations between our systems and scripts that automate the lifecycle of servers on the Maxihost platform.

We're looking for enthusiastic and resourceful software engineers who are passionate about building great products, someone who loves being part of a team, whilst enjoying the autonomous nature of working remotely.

- Work with your peers to build new features and extend existing ones, using modern, performant technologies.

- Review code from the rest of the team.

- Collaborate with engineers across the department to identify and build on improvements to our processes and systems.


**You might be a fit for this role if**

- You have experience writing automated tests

- You have knowledge in HTTP, cookies, caching, AJAX, cross-domain sharing, etc.

- You have knowledge in REST

- You are either an English-native or have proficiency in both writing and speaking the language.

- You have previously worked on scaling enterprise software and infrastructure.

- You are a pragmatic engineer who actively avoids over-engineering of solutions and understands how to maintain a high-quality code in a delivery-focused environment.

- You are someone who wishes to work in a respectful, transparent, and collaborative work environment.

- You are a person who values collaboration with your peers to deliver exceptional experiences.

We know that diversity of thought makes for the best problem-solving and creative thinking, which is why we're dedicated to adding new perspectives to the team and encourage everyone to apply.
