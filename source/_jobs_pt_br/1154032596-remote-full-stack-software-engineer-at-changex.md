# [REMOTE] Full Stack Software Engineer at ChangeX

## About ChangeX

We are ChangeX. We have built a platform to connect communities to proven innovations and finance.

Our mission? To empower people everywhere to change their communities for the better by making it easy for them to access the innovations, funding and support they need. So far, more than 17,000 community projects have started through ChangeX, scaling almost 100 innovations and benefitting over 600,000 people.

Our business model is called Impact as a Service. We make it easy for funders to invest in the innovations they want to spread in regions they care most about. Our partners include Microsoft, Accenture, Lego Foundation and AWS. 

We are in an exciting growth phase, as we prepare to launch in multiple new regions. And we are growing our team across all functions to deliver on this growth.

### Our team and how we work:

We are simplifying and accelerating the way people fund, start and grow projects in their communities. We’re looking for engineers who share our belief in the power of great technology to transform lives.

Remote working is part of our company’s DNA. For example, our development team currently works remotely, with team members in Dublin and Mayo in Ireland, Barcelona in Spain and Joinville in Brazil.

As a development team, we run a lightweight process that focuses on feature-based delivery on a weekly basis. Our coordination and communication are mostly through daily ‘catch-up meetings’ and use of appropriate tools such as Trello for backlog management, Slack for communication and Git(GitHub) for source control and feature deployment through PRs and Milestones.

We make use of peer review for all design and development work. In general, we strive for an approach that empowers and trusts individuals to ‘do the right thing’.

- Confidence playing a significant role in the vision and development direction of the product
