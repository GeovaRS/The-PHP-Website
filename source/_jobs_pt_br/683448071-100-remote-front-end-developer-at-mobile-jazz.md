# [100% Remote] Front-end Developer at Mobile Jazz

## Nossa empresa

Founded in 2011, [Mobile Jazz](https://mobilejazz.com/) has evolved from a mobile app development agency to a full-stack technology partner, including development services like backend, frontend, native mobile, embedded systems, UX & design, and security.

We’re a fully remote working company with team members spread all over the world, from Thailand to the Czech Republic, although many of us are based in Barcelona, where the company previously had an office. All our communication is in English.

Although we work in the CET timezone, our work schedule is flexible. We don’t have restrictions on holidays and time off, and many of our team continue to work with us while traveling the world. As long as you deliver the work you’ve committed to, that’s what matters to us.

You can find out a bit more about us by reading our [company handbook](https://mobilejazz.com/docs/company-handbook/mobile-jazz-company-handbook.pdf), which has had nearly 100,000 downloads since going live in March. We’re proud to say that our average employee stay is three years — more than double the average for our industry. And we’ve got a long list of retained clients, based everywhere from Melbourne to San Francisco. We take immense pride from the fact that they trust our expertise, methodologies and market knowledge.
