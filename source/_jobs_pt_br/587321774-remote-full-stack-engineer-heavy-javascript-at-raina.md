# [Remote] Full stack engineer (heavy JavaScript) at Raina

**Raina is Hiring!**

Raina is a premium, b2b music streaming solution for hospitality and retail businesses. Our mission is to make sure that every bar, restaurant, hotel, and retail outlet always has great music.

We bootstrapped to 60 clients and over $12,000 MRR in the last year with our MVP, which is an admin web app that lets our team build out custom mixes / calendars for clients and lets them log in through an iOS app, see those calendars, and control the music (we give them an iPad if needed when they start).

We are in a strong position to grow our team and then fundraise. We are looking for a technical leader to build out the new version of our platform and to provide them with the resources needed for them to build out the rest of our product team.

**Here are some basic requirements:**

- Full stack engineer (heavy JavaScript) with extensive experience building web apps and cross platform apps (iPhone, iPad, Android)
- 10+ years experience
- Prior experience building startups
- Will provide competitive salary and equity

More important than those qualities is that we are looking for a leader who wants to own product and enjoys the freedom to build the new, more scalable version of Raina, you'll be able to grow and get rewarded on our company.
If we succeed in our mission, we will never have to go out and hear bad music again.
