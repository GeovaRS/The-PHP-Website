# [Remote] Senior Backend Developer @ Nomad Homes

## Nossa empresa

[Nomad](https://workat.nomadhomes.co/) is looking for a Senior Backend Software Engineer to help in our mission to make buying homes in EMEA ridiculously easy. While we can trade stocks, order cars, or book short-term stays seamlessly online, the process of buying a home across the region remains slow, paper-driven, and inefficient. We’re building an end-to-end experience to empower buyers to search, transact, and finance under one roof.

Our founding team consists of operational, engineering, and real estate professionals from Uber, Addepar, UberEats, and PeerStreet. We are also ex-Blackstone, Goldman Sachs, Gilt, General Assembly and Jump. We launched in 2020 and now have operations in both Dubai and Paris. We are a Series A company with rockstar investors including Comcast Ventures, Partech, Abstract Ventures, Precursor Ventures, WndrCo, and Class 5 Global.

As a Backend Software Engineer you will work on core user-facing product for multiple markets and back-office tools. Joining our small development team at such an early stage means you will have significant impact on our product and engineering with many opportunities to learn and grow.
