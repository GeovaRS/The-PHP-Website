# [Florianópolis] Full Stack Developer @ InPulse

## InPulse Animal Health

Here at [InPulse](https://inpulse.vet.br/), each one of us is committed and versatile and is always seeking to improve the way we work. Responsibility, trust, and initiative summarize well our healthy cooperation around here. If you are willing to learn something new every day, if you are addicted to technology (like us) and if for you “a given mission is an accomplished one”, excellent! Keep reading.

We offer high standard technology-based solutions for veterinary professionals. With reasonably horizontal engineering, we develop hardware, embedded software, desktop applications, android apps, back and front ends for several purposes. And by doing that, we manage to make products that perfectly fit our customers' expectations. And they love that!

With a Startup mindset, we are growing fast! And we would like you to come aboard, to help us deliver world-class products to deal with animals' health the way they deserve to be cared for.

## What will you do:

We use and love Kotlin. Like, a lot. We are migrating some of our codebases to Kotlin – when it makes sense: for back-end on different microservices, common shared libraries, desktop application, and android. Perhaps also even on the front-end, with Kotlin-JS.

You will code with other 3-5 co-workers, writing software for either internal and external usage. From database to end-user UX design, if applicable. But we dare you to beat us at Table Tennis \o/

## What is required from you:

* Commitment and responsibility! The base layer;
* Organization for cleaning up your code after finishing the implementation. Like washing your dishes after eating;
* 2 years experience in Kotlin or Java;
* English is mandatory for reading;

**Extra**

Additionally, this extra knowledge will come in handy, and will be kindly considered:

* Experience with Python/Django;
* Database management – MySQL, Postgres;
* Spring (Boot) Framework;
* JavaScript and front-end application;
* Microservices;
* Kubernetes;

## What do we offer

* A nice environment to enhance your skills;
* Flexibility to work part-time from home, if you will;
* Food and drink at our costs;
* Free beers in our happy hours – really nice way to let ideas flow;
* Full-time contract (8 hours/day);
* Salary around R$4.000;
* Benefits, such as meal and fuel vouchers;

## Location

Florianópolis-SC
