# [REMOTE] Engineering Lead @ CloserIQ


## About us

At CloserIQ, we are creating technologies to help companies build high performance teams and empower sustainable growth. Founded by engineers from MIT and Penn, we’re bootstrapped, profitable and have since worked with over 500+ global brands. We’re now looking for our first engineering hire to accelerate our product development and build an engineering team around them.

## About the role

We’re looking for an engineering leader passionate about building teams as much as writing code. Initially you’ll work directly with our CTO, own major components of our products and deliver features end to end. Once you’re ramped up you’ll help recruit a small team of engineers which you’ll supervise and mentor.

You’ll be able to work on impactful projects across all of our products, from improving the matching algorithm in our CRM to designing a brand new app to enable users in our community to connect. Some of the technology in our stack includes Python, Flask, MySQL, Ansible, React, and Firebase. As a lean engineering team, we choose the best tool for the job, iterate quickly on features, and run the entire product development cycle with direct inputs from our users.

## Responsibilities

- Recruit and lead a small team of high performing engineers
- Own delivery of major product features and improvements
- Collaborate with the business teams to shape product roadmap
- Lead code reviews to improve software quality and implement best practices
- Help define processes and contribute to culture and career development for future engineers

## Requirements

- 5+ years of professional software development experience
- 1+ years of full stack web development experience in Python or a similar object oriented language
- 1+ years of managing a team of engineers including junior level engineers
- You have a deep understanding of modern web technologies and ability to clean, well documented, and rigorously tested code
- You have experience with defining processes and best practices for a growing team
- Bonus if you have significant product experience
- Bonus if you have worked at an early stage startup
