We’re continuing to expand and build new features, to be implemented during the next 2 years, and we need someone with good experience to help us deliver them with quality. At the same time, we’ve been building this project for the past 2.5 years, and we have lots of opportunities to improve our stack.

* Excellent engineer - you understand and advocate for testing, analytics, observability and error tolerance.
* Product mindset - you can challenge product features, propose simpler implementation, and propose excellent technical decisions to improve user experience.

### What we work with

We believe everyone can learn on the job, that's why we won't require you to know everything.

* Nodejs (**required**)
* Koajs (bonus)
* Sequelize (bonus)
* Postgres (**required**)
* React (**required**)
* Redux (**required**)
* Redis (bonus)
