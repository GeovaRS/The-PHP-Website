# [Remote] Staff Software Engineer @Evernote

## Nossa empresa

Evernote, the world’s original note taking application, with millions of active users and billions of notes, is going through an exciting transformation over a decade into its existence. On the front-end, we’ve completely re-written our apps to be based on a common React JS code base that is hosted on Electron for Desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) and ReactNative for Mobile (Android and iOS). On the back-end we’re reconfiguring our services from a monolithic stack into a rich and loosely coupled distributed services framework. All of this is to be able to deploy new features more than 5x-10x faster and more reliably than before.

Come and join our rapidly growing team!
